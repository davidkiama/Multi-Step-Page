# Multi Step Process

This is a basic web structure of a multi-step-process. It can be used in multiple projects or pages but I built it with signup pages in mind.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
